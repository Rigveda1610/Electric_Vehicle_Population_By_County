  Electric Vehicle (EV) Adoption Forecasting in Washington State

This project predicts future electric vehicle (EV) adoption trends across 27 counties in **Washington State** using a machine learning model and visualizes results through an interactive **Streamlit web app**.

---

##  Features

-  Forecast EV adoption trends for the next 3 years
-  County-wise selection and visualization
-  Compare EV growth trends across up to 3 counties
-  Machine Learning powered (Decision Tree Regressor)
-  Clean and interactive UI built with Streamlit

---

##  Problem Statement

While EV adoption is rapidly increasing, local governments lack tools to forecast future trends at the **county level**. This leads to challenges in:

- Charging infrastructure planning
- Policy making
- Regional comparison of EV growth

---

##  Solution

- Use historical EV registration data from Washington State
- Apply a `DecisionTreeRegressor` to model and forecast EV growth
- Deploy an interactive web interface with Streamlit
- Visualize and compare growth for any selected county
